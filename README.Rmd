The goal of zSocial is to provide users with a one-stop shop to pull and query social media data ( + visualize) from multiple API endpoints in R. There are many great R packages which pull API data from RESTful (and other) endpoints, this package works on top of them to simplify common user flows and aggregate package loading + functions. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ctzn-pub/zSocial")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the `searchUS` function, which returns an excel workbook with data from Google Trends in the USA. 

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(zSocial)

searchUS(c("Donald Trump", "Joe Biden"), "politics" )

```


```{r}
##See the data 
data<- rio::import("politics_US.xlsx", sheet ="interest_over_time")
knitr::kable(head(data))
```
